* Prior to run 12415, DAQ was not reporting correct run number but zero.  So manually did 12321-12414.

* Prior to run 11669, the Faraday cup ofset was negative, so accurate beam charge calculations not possible from Faraday cup.  Will have to use archived BPMs if necessary to normalize those early runs.
